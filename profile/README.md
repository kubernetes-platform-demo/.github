For the **bsa demo** with the two repositories (**base-layer** and **service-layer**) and the addition of the **microservices-demo**, here's how you can structure and manage these repositories effectively for development, deployment, and demonstration purposes:

### Repository Breakdown and Purpose

#### 1. **Base-Layer Repository**
   - **Purpose**: This repository contains the foundational infrastructure setup required for any application. It's your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) layer.
   - **Contents**:
     - Terraform, CloudFormation, or Pulumi code for provisioning infrastructure (e.g., VPC, subnets, IAM roles, EKS clusters).
     - Kubernetes manifests for cluster setup (if not managed by Helm).
     - Networking configurations (e.g., VPN, security groups, DNS setup).
     - CI/CD pipeline templates for deploying infrastructure.
     - Documentation for infrastructure setup and prerequisites.

#### 2. **Service-Layer Repository**
   - **Purpose**: This repository holds all the application services deployed on top of the platform.
   - **Contents**:
     - Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests for deploying microservices.
     - Configuration files for services (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets).
     - CI/CD workflows for deploying and updating services.
     - Dockerfiles and service-specific configurations.
     - Logging, monitoring, and alerting configurations.

#### 3. **Microservices-Demo Repository**
   - **Purpose**: This repository is a showcase of the microservices architecture built on top of the infrastructure and service layers.
   - **Contents**:
     - Example microservices (e.g., frontend, backend, databases, APIs).
     - Mock data and testing tools.
     - Documentation explaining the demo architecture, flows, and how to run it.
     - CI/CD pipelines for deploying demo services.
